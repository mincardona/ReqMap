# ReqMap
This Chrome extension collects IP addresses from browser connections, geocodes them, and exports the results in CSV format.
To pack the extension, download the files into a folder (probably called "ReqMap"). Open Chrome and click the hamburger menu, then select "More tools > Extensions". Check the "Developer mode" box, and click "Pack extension...". Select the ReqMap directory as the "Extension root directory". Ignore the second field and click "Pack Extension".
